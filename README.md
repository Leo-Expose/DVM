# DVM

Welcome to the **DIGITAL VOTING MACHINE**, the ultimate solution for democracy, took me way too much effort

## Features

- **Vote for Head Boy**: Because one person needs to rule them all.
- **Vote for Head Girl**: Equality
- **Vote for General Captain**: For those who are neither here nor there but still want to rule something.
- **Admin Control Panel**: Absolutely no purpose, useless code that I forgot to delete, btw the code won't work if you delete this

## Usage

1. **Start Voting**: 
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7000/` OR `http://localhost:7000/admin`. (i forgot about this part)
   - Click "Start Voting" and pray nothing breaks. (12% success rate)
   
2. **Cast Votes**:
   - Open `http://localhost:7000` on any device that can connect to your local network or just don't. (just do this on individual computers and manually add)
   - Log in for security (basically any name and admission number from the Voters.csv file, don't forget to add your list of names).
   - Vote for your favorite candidates to support the democrazy!


## Files

- **server.js**: Don't touch this file, I have no idea how it works
- **Voters.csv**: Where all the voters are stored. Feel free to add *thelittlealchemist*'s imaginary friends here.
- **Votes/V.csv**: Stores the votes. No tampering, unless you're a candidate
- **resources/**: Contains literally everything necessary. DO NOT TOUCH
